Gathering and cleaning data

The list relies on two main resources:

**U.S. Higher Education Institutions Awarding the Most Financial Aid to International Undergraduate Students**

**Resource:** [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6Foe6rLi1WtTTlYQVItdG10MEU/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6Foe6rLi1WtTTlYQVItdG10MEU/view).

This document lists four types of schools: &quot;for-profit 2yr&quot;, &quot;for-profit 4yr&quot;, &quot;private 2yr&quot;, &quot;private 4yr&quot;, &quot;public 2yr&quot;, and &quot;public 4yr&quot;. For our purposes, we are only interested in private and public schools which offer 4-year programs mainly because these types of schools provide more financial aid than for-profit schools (and offer a bachelor degree).

After obtaining only those schools, their average financial aid for international students is compared to the [Average Estimated Undergraduate Budgets, 2016-17](https://trends.collegeboard.org/college-pricing/figures-tables/average-estimated-undergraduate-budgets-2016-17). Schools who has an average financial aid greater or equal to 75% of the average estimated budgets are filtered.

Notice that this is not the best approach. Ideally, schools should be filtered according to their average financial aid and their estimated costs of attendance. However, there are over 900 schools in the U.S. Higher Education Institutions Awarding the Most Financial Aid to International Undergraduate Students. Trying to analyze the data based on the &#39;ideal scenario&#39; would take much time, probably too much time that the costs would already be higher once the costs per institution has been obtained :)

**Relied-on-human data**

There are many universities which might not have a high average financial aid for internationals but offer grants which can cover great part of (or the total) the cost of attendance. Additionally, on the previous process, there might have been schools which can give good amounts of financial aid and were removed from the list. For instance, a &quot;cheap&quot; school which average financial aid did not get to the 75% of the **national** average cost of attendance. After all, it is not the same to study in Utah than to study in California.

The schools which meet the criteria above are listed in a specific section with links to resources where students can learn about their grants.
